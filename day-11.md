# Day 11

Today was more productive than I anticipated, a large part of that was by working in groups to problem solve as we got stuck along the way. I was ultimately able to check most technical requirements off my list, but was not able to properly tally each time an image was clicked to display in the final list. Overall, happy that I was able to figure out how to get several items working on my own and help my peers and vice versa.
