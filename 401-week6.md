# 401 Week 6

So far we are learning the very basics of React. This seems like it will be a very useful tool to manipulate the DOM, but a decent challenge to fully understand how it works and how to properly write it. Some main takeaways are that ternary statements are a good way of changing what is displayed in the DOM depending on different user input and that thinking how a javascript function is written is helpful for establishing how React will behave with it's functions. It is pretty interesting how interactive our labs have been with only scratching the surface of React.
