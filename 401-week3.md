# 401 Week 3

So far we have integrated express into our server.js which has made routing so much cleaner and easier to read than last week. I can appreciate knowing how the middleware opperates and how convenient it is to use something pre-built. I think the most time consuming part of lab assignments has been the testing. They started out fairly simple in week one, but have become exponentially more complex each week.
