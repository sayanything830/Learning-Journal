# 401 Week 3

So far we have integrated express into our server.js which has made routing so much cleaner and easier to read than last week. I can appreciate knowing how the middleware opperates and how convenient it is to use something pre-built. I think the most time consuming part of lab assignments has been the testing. They started out fairly simple in week one, but have become exponentially more complex each week.

Today we were inttroduced to MongoDB and the mongoose library. This seems like a useful tool when creating and adding to a larger database as long as the information being stored is not an image and is not being used for mobile applications.
