# 401 Week 4

This week has introduced basic authorization and bearer authorization. Both have been an interesting lesson in how to encode a password in a way that prevents the developer from knowing the password and improving the security. Adding this with relational data in a database has been a nice review of the topics learned last week. I am finding it easier each time to set up a server, routes, schemas, and saving data to a database.
