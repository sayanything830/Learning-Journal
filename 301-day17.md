# 301 Day 17

This week was a great learning opportunity to create a full stack application from scratch. I spent 3 hours of our lab time on Friday debugging my app to see why it was not properly updating the database just to find out it was missing a comma. While slightly embarrassing that it was a small syntax error, it was a great opportunity to learn my application code inside and out. Once the bug was fixed, the remainder of the lab assignment went relatively smoothly and we are getting books to load from Google's Book API. Only bug left to fix is figure out why we cannot add the book to our own library.
