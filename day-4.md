# Day 4 journal

Today's assignment involved learning functions and how they help simplify code. The general idea is that for every formula that is used repetitively, it can be simplified into function and reused through a program as needed without needing to type out all the code every time. We then broke into pair projects where a driver and navigator were determined. The driver was responsible for writing code while the navigator instructed the driver on what to type and ways to organize data. My partner Dan had prior experience with functions and was a great help to problem solve when bugs appeared and explaining why they happened. Overall, this was a very informative lab day and though our skills varied, we were able to communicate well and execute our objectives effectively.
