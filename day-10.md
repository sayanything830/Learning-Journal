#Day 10

Still can't get my salmon cookies table exactly how I want it, but will probably improve over the weekend. Worked on making CSS layouts today which was a welcome change of pace from earlier in the week. So far feeling like puzzle pieces are coming together with javascript and things that made no sense earlier in the week are more straight-forward now. Looking forward to the weekend and starting fresh on Monday.
