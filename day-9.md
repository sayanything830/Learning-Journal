# Day 9

Today was all about styling and making our salmon cookie site look pretty. Not much javascript involved today, but still a decent amount of time committed to fixing strange CSS quirks. Fixed a bug the TA pointed out about why my table data wasn't lining up with my table header. Feeling like this week is ending on a positive note.
