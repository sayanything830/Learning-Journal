# 301 Day 11

The end of this week focused on using SQL to join tables in a database, add articles to them, and update them. Since we had only learned about the basics of SQL on Wednesday, Friday's lab was challenging, but we still managed to finish in the allotted time.

The UI challenge this weekend was a refreshing change of pace to get back to CSS styling tricks using sprites to load images. The more I work on back-end coding, the more I am appreciating and enjoying front-end projects.
