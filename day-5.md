# Day 5 journal

Today we learned a very efficient and effective way of using the browser to modify our CSS and the use of a reset.css file to over-write browser resets. We also learned how branches are created in GitHub and the process of pulling and pushing modifications made to files and merging them back to a master branch. The lab involved using branches on GitHub repositories to solve problems in javascript with additional test code to verify our problems are solved a specific way. Each individual problem was check out as a different branch so all changes could be tracked.
