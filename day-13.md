# Day 13

Today was a bit tougher than yesterday to problem solve getting my localStorage working. After talking to a TA, I realized I was making the process a lot more complicated than it needed to be and got my browser to save data appropriately. Phase 2 was getting the saved data to be appropriately applied when refreshing the website and immediately displaying the chart or results. My only bug now is that my removeEventListener method is not actually stopping the images from being clicked once the browser reloads.
