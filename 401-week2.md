# 401 week 2

This week has been a challenge to balance sleep with getting work submitted on time. The labs we have finished have been fun for the most part. I never expected I would be able to create my own body-parser module, a url-parser module, a built out module for RESTful http method without using a node package, and a TCP chat room. It's been a great, but tiring week!
