# 401 Week 8

This has been a tough week with building full stack applications each day and adding on several components. My biggest challenge is figuring out how to get a page to redirect on the initial sign up of a user for an application. The presence of a token should trigger the redirect, but when the database is empty, the first user is not redirected. All actions after the user manually goes to their dashboard work as intended.

While new material is less each day, the amount expected to complete each lab is exponential. Looking forward to the weekend and resetting before whiteboard final exams next week.
