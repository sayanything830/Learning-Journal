# 301 Day 15

The book app labs have been challenging this week, but have made a huge difference in learning the material to figure out how the back end communicates with the front end. I struggled on the first day of the app, but the second day went much smoother as everything came together. I am also happy that I have left in the evening on both days with a working app.
