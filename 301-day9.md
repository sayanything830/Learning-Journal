# 301 Day 9

The last two days have taken a more in depth look at back end programming. We have incorporated node.js into our code and are looking at how the server.js file interacts with other script files to perform operation on the back end. The initial set up in lab 7 was fairly straightforward from the lecture notes. Today's lab involved reviewing more complex coding and figuring out what it does and how it works with other files. While I do not think I would have been able to come up with all the code on my own in 5 hours, it was great practicing my code reading skills with this lab. It will come in handy with labs next week when we will be building an app from scratch.
