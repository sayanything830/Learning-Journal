# Day 12

Today we used a plug in to enter our data from BusMall into bar charts. Initially, I needed to complete my code from yesterday to get my counter working for each time an image was clicked. Once I added a few lines to recognize the id on the image element, I was able to get my counter tracking properly and moved on to making my chart. Plug-ins are WAAAY easier than writing out functions, so this part of today's lab went very quickly. Happy with my product, the only thing to work on is making my content prettier.
