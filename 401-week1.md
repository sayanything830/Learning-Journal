# 401 Week 1

So far this week has been a deep dive into JavaScript and all the intricacies of the language. We have learned more about asynchronous code, callback functions, node.js and it's modules, and testing code. I have enjoyed writing tests since it gives a better insight of what a function should do and helps organize the thought process. Each day the whiteboard challenges have increased in difficulty, but I am enjoying getting the practice of writing pseudocode and making each practice look cleaner than the one before it.
