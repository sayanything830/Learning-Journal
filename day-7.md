# Day 7 Journal

Just as yesterday, today was going very well getting my constructor functions working, but as soon as I started trying to manipulate my DOM by adding a table, things fell apart. After several inquiries amongst classmates and TAs, I was able to successfully get my table header working, but unfortunately, I am unable to populate the table with the contents from my constructor function and method. I have an idea of how to get it done, but am missing the proper syntax to get the code working. Besides that, it was a good day!
