# 401 Week 9

This week feels like things are being wrapped up. So far we learned how to implement O-Auth to have Google provide the authentication process of a user before adding a token from our back-end to provide authorization. We have also covered sorting algorithms and will be covering other data structures relevant to technical interviews. This week is also our first whiteboard exit interview, so the stress it up a little bit to study up on all data structures covered in class up to this point.
