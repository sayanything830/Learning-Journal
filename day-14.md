# Day 14

Today was mostly spent working on choosing final project ideas and start hashing away at the details and identifying tasks to create. My app idea was chosen for a 201 student study guide that will take user input of the topic they would like to study, then spits out 'flashcards' that will be animated through CSS to show answers to problems when the user hovers or clicks on the image of the problem. I am looking forward to getting some basic code written for this project and hopefully having a solid project AND excellent study guid tool.
