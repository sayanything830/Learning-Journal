## 301 Day 5

Today's lab involved incorporating templates using the Handlebars.js platform. We also worked on refactoring functions with the fat arrow method to see how it affected our code. This was a relatively simple lab compared to yesterday's which involved making the blog site more dynamic with searchable features and creating a single page app with changing content.

I have continued to find the Code Wars challenges interesting and keeping me on my toes with figuring out new ways of writing functions to get cleaner code.
