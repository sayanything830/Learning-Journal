# Day 8

Today was a much better day than yesterday. I relied heavily on the TA's help to help problem solve why my constructer code kept breaking, but after reviewing the properly working code, I can understand where it failed (not calling on the function when needed) and the steps to fix it. My goal now is to return to the code I wrote yesterday and get my tables working with lab 7's requirements.
