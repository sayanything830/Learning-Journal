# Day 6 journal

Today started off really well, I was understanding object literals and was able to organize my lab with a general plan of how to make each store represented by an object. This came crashing to a halt when I could not for the life of me get my 'for' loops to work in a method! I was making multiple attempts and sought help from TAs and classmates a few times, but ultimately had to leave my 'for' loops outside of my methods, which in turn makes it less reusable. Since I spent several hours working on getting my JS to work, I was not able to put as much time as I would prefer into making the sales and index pages look as nice as I could. Hopefully I'll get things sorted out tomorrow! I figure at this point, it's better to get some decent sleep tonight and try again tomorrow.
