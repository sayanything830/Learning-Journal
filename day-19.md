# Day 19

Today was the last day of finishing touches with the final project. We were able to achieve a couple more stretch goals including a quiz for javascript, css and html topics, added a local storage feature that creates a unique greeting for the user, and added a chart for the quiz results. I am so proud of my team for putting our nose to the grindstone and getting things done today I did not expect to get done. Looking forward to the final presentations tomorrow and celebrating with my classmates.
