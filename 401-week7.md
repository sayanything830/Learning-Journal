# 401 Week 7

This week we are looking deeper into 'state' and how to manage it with React and Redux. Redux creates a store that manages the state of certain components specified in our React code. Through a system of reducers and actions, we can specify actions to take place on the state. Since state itself is immutable, changes to the state essentially create a copy with changes the specified by the reducer.
