# 401 Week 7

This week we are looking deeper into 'state' and how to manage it with React and Redux. Redux creates a store that manages the state of certain components specified in our React code. Through a system of reducers and actions, we can specify actions to take place on the state. Since state itself is immutable, changes to the state essentially create a copy with changes the specified by the reducer.

We have also been introduced to Redux middleware and it's use to keep track of state as it changes through an application. This allows us to see if the changes occurring are the correct changes and a better idea of where they are breaking if they are not.
